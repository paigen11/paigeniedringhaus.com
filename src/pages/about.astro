      <h2>Hey, I'm Paige Niedringhaus.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack lead software engineer, technical writer, and speaker, originally from St. Louis, MO 🇺🇸.

      <h2>Web development wasn't my first job...</h2>
      <p>
        Software development hasn't always been my focus. After graduating high school, I attended&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Emory University
        </a>
        &nbsp;and graduated from the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Goizueta Business School
        </a>
        &nbsp;with a Bachelor's of Business Administration and concentrations in Marketing, Management and International Business 🎓.
        I then worked as a digital marketer and content strategist for several advertising agencies before I made the decision to pursue a total career change to web development in 2016.

        &nbsp;is the immersive coding bootcamp I attended, and I've been writing software ever since 💻.
        If you want to hear more about how I got started in web development, I shared my origin story on the podcast&nbsp;

      <h2>And now, I want to help others find the joy in coding too.</h2>
      <p>
        Today, I work with a team of talented folks as a lead software engineer at&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.allspice.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          AllSpice
        </a>. I'm always learning new things, but my focus and interest right now is on&nbsp;
        <strong>
          GenAI, and web development technologies like Next.js, Svelte, Astro, and Go
        </strong>
        , and building polished, performant user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Previously, I was a staff software engineer at Blues and a senior software engineer at The Home Depot.</p>
      <p>
        Bringing cool user interfaces to life with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and solving new problems daily is what I enjoy most about my job.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I also love seeing other developers improve, build fun things they dreamed up, and succeed in their careers, which is why I mentor devs, write about what I've learned online, and speak at conferences and meetups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've written regularly on&nbsp;
        <a href="https://paigen11.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Medium
        </a>
        &nbsp;and other <a href="/media">publications</a> about web development and technology for years, but I wanted to build my own site to share my knowledge with a broader audience (and hopefully learn new things from them as well!).
        I hope you find my&nbsp;
        <a href="/blog">posts</a>&nbsp;useful as you build your own awesome stuff.

      <h2>If you want to know more about me personally...</h2>
      <p>
        I met my husband, Sean, while I was working in Atlanta, GA, and we've been happily married since 2016 (that was a really good year for me).
      </p>
      <p>
        And when I'm not programming, I like to spend my spare time working on my art 🎨, scuba diving, traveling ✈️, and hanging out with family and friends.
        I've recently gotten into mastering handbalancing and botanical watercolor painting, so if you have tips, let me know!
