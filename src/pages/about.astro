    <section>
      <h2>Hey, I'm Paige Niedringhaus.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a full-stack software engineer, technical writer, podcast co-host, and occasional conference speaker. St. Louis born, dev community raised 🇺🇸.

      <h2>Web development wasn't my first job...</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't start here. I have a BBA from&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emory University</a>'s&nbsp;
        <a href="https://goizueta.emory.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goizueta Business School</a>
        &nbsp;and spent several years as a digital marketer and content strategist before deciding that building things was more fun than marketing them 🎓. In 2016, I blew up my career in the best possible way.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigitalCrafts</a>
        &nbsp;was the bootcamp that started it all — and I haven't looked back 💻.
        If you're curious about the full origin story, I told it on&nbsp;
        <a href="https://topenddevs.com/podcasts/my-javascript-story/mjs-143-paige-niedringhaus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My JavaScript Story</a>
        &nbsp;and wrote a few&nbsp;
        <a href="/blog/how-i-went-from-a-digital-marketer-to-a-software-engineer-in-4-months">posts</a>
        &nbsp;about the leap.

      <h2>And now, I want to help others find the joy in coding too.</h2>
      <p>
        These days I'm a lead software engineer at&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.allspice.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AllSpice</a>,
        working at the intersection of hardware and software. My current obsessions:
        <strong>GenAI, and web technologies like Next.js, Svelte, Astro, and Go</strong>.
        Previously I was a staff engineer at Blues and a senior engineer at The Home Depot.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not writing code, I'm usually talking about it. I co-host two podcasts —&nbsp;
        <a href="https://front-end-fire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Front-end Fire</a>,
        a weekly frontend news show with Jack Herrington and TJ VanToll, and&nbsp;
        <a href="https://podrocket.logrocket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PodRocket</a>,
        LogRocket's web dev podcast 🎙️. I also write regularly here, on&nbsp;
        <a href="https://paigen11.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>,
        and at a few other&nbsp;<a href="/archive">publications</a> — mostly because figuring something out is only half the fun.

      <h2>If you want to know more about me personally...</h2>
      <p>
        I met my husband Sean while working in Atlanta — married since 2016, best decision I've made that didn't involve a code editor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work I paint 🎨, scuba dive, travel, and spend time with people I like. Lately I've been working on handbalancing and botanical watercolor, with varying degrees of success — so if you have tips, my <a href="mailto:hellopaigen@gmail.com">DMs are open</a>.
