          <p>Previously, I was a senior software engineer at The Home Depot.</p>

            Bringing cool user interfaces to life with HTML, CSS and JavaScript,

          <p>
            But I also love seeing other developers improve, build fun things
            they dreamed up, and succeed in their careers, which is why I mentor
            devs, write about what I've learned online, and speak at conferences
            and meetups.

          <p>
            I met my husband, Sean, while I was working in Atlanta, GA, and
            we've been happily married since 2016 (that was a really good year
            for me, in case you haven't noticed).
          </p>
          <p>
            And when I'm not programming, I like to spend my spare time working
            on my art üé® (watercolors), traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, and hanging out with
            family and friends. I've recently gotten into mastering handstands
            and handbalancing, so if you have tips, let me know!
